# Resources and Limits

- Every Pod consumes set of resources - CPU, MEMORY, DISK SPACE of Node.
- Kubernetes scheduler decides which pod will place on which node. Scheduler takes into consideration of the amount of the resources available on the node and how much resources needs for a Pod.
- If the Node has insufficient resources, scheduler avoids placing the pod on that node. And place the pod on that node, where Node has sufficient resources for the pod.
- If scheduler doesn't find any Node with sufficient resources for the pods, scheduler holds back to place the pod. In this case Pods will be in Pending states. Check events -
  - `kubectl get pods` will return the `Events` with `FailedScheduling: .... Insufficent cpu (3)`

## Resource Requirements

- By default, Kubernetes assumes that a Pod or a container within a Pod requires `0.5` CPU and `256 Mi` MEMORY.
- The minimum amount of resources of cpu and memory requires for a container, known as `Resource Request`.
- In container, there is no limit of resources to use by each containers.
- In Kubernetes, by default, it is limited for each container. `1 vCPU`, `512 Mi`
- Define resource request in POD definition file.
- If Pod needs beyond the limited CPU, Kubernetes throtles the CPU, so it doens't go beyond the limit.
- If Pod needs beyond the limited MEMORY, Pod can go beyond in case of MEMORY.
  - But if the POD uses more memory continuesly than it's limit, then POD will be TERMINATED automatically.

```yaml
# pod-definition with Resources
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: simple-webapp
spec:
  containers:
  - image: nginx
    name: simple-webapp-container
    ports:
      - containerPort: 8080
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: "1Gi"
        cpu: 1
  nodeName: node01
```

```yaml
# pod-definition with Limits
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: simple-webapp
spec:
  containers:
  - image: nginx
    name: simple-webapp-container
    ports:
      - containerPort: 8080
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: "1Gi"
        cpu: 1
      limits:
        memory: "2Gi"
        cpu: 2
  nodeName: node01
```

- Gigabyte (G) = 1000 Megabytes
  - 1G (Gigabyte) = 1,000,000,000 bytes
  - 1M (Megabyte) = 1,000,000 bytes
  - 1K (Kilobyte) = 1,000 bytes
- Gibibyte (Gi) = 1024 Mebibytes
  - 1Gi (Gibibyte) = 1,073,741,824 bytes
  - 1Mi (Mebibyte) = 1,048,576 bytes
  - 1Ki (Kibibyte) = 1,024 bytes

## LimitRange

- For the POD to pick up desired defaults value for resources, then you must have first set those as default values for request and limit by creating a LimitRange in that namespace.

```yaml
# Set memory-cpu LimitRange
apiVersion: v1
kind: LimitRange
metadata:
  name: mem-cpu-limit-range
spec:
  limits:
  - default:
      memory: 512Mi
      cpu: 1
    defaultRequest:
      memory: 256Mi
      cpu: 0.5
    type: Container
---
# Set memory LimitRange
apiVersion: v1
kind: LimitRange
metadata:
  name: mem-limit-range
spec:
  limits:
  - default:
      memory: 512Mi
    defaultRequest:
      memory: 256Mi
    type: Container
---
# Set cpu LimitRange
apiVersion: v1
kind: LimitRange
metadata:
  name: cpu-limit-range
spec:
  limits:
  - default:
      cpu: 1
    defaultRequest:
      cpu: 0.5
    type: Container
```

### Edit a POD

- Remember, you CANNOT edit specifications of an existing POD other than the below.
  - spec.containers[*].image
  - spec.initContainers[*].image
  - spec.activeDeadlineSeconds
  - spec.tolerations
- For example you cannot edit the environment variables, service accounts, resource limits (all of which we will discuss later) of a running pod.

- Run the kubectl edit pod `<pod name>` command.  This will open the pod specification in an editor (vi editor). Then edit the required properties. When you try to save it, you will be denied. This is because you are attempting to edit a field on the pod that is not editable.
  - A copy of the file with your changes is saved in a temporary location
  - delete the existing pod by running the command: `kubectl delete pod webapp`
  - Then create a new pod with your changes using the temporary file `kubectl create -f /tmp/kubectl-edit-ccvrq.yaml`
- The second option is to extract the pod definition in YAML format to a file using the command
  - `kubectl get pod webapp -o yaml > my-new-pod.yaml`
  - Edit the pod definition file - `vi my-new-pod.yaml`
  - Then delete the existing pod - `kubectl delete pod webapp`
  - Then create a new pod with the edited file - `kubectl create -f my-new-pod.yaml`

### Edit Deployments

- With Deployments you can easily edit any field/property of the POD template. Since the pod template is a child of the deployment specification,  with every change the deployment will automatically delete and create a new pod with the new changes. So if you are asked to edit a property of a POD part of a deployment you may do that simply by running the command
  - `kubectl edit deployment my-deployment`
