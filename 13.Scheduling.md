# Scheduling

## Manual Scheduling

- Manually scheduling POD
- POD definition file has a field called `nodeName`, kubernetes adds it automatically.
- Scheduler identifies the `nodeName` and places the POD in the particular node.
- Once the pod is created, kubernetes doesn't allow to modify the `nodeName`.
- If there is no scheduler (If the `nodeName` is missing from pod definition file), then to create a `Binding` object to bind the pod with a particular node.

- Every POD has a field called `NodeName` that by default is not set. Kubernetes adds it automatically.
- The Scheduler goes through all the pods and looks for those that don't have this property set. Those are the candidates for scheduling.
- It then identifies the right node for the POD, by running the scheduling algorithm.
- Once identify, it schedules the POD on the Node by setting the `nodeName` property to the name of the Node by creating a binding object.
- If there is no Scheduler to monitor & schedule Nodes -
  - The POD continues to be in Pending State.

  ```yaml
  # pod-definition.yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Pod
  metadata:
    name: nginx
    labels:
      name: nginx
  spec:
    containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
        ports:
          - containerPort: 8080
    nodeName: node01
  ```

  - To overcome this, assign Node manually in the POD definition file and then create the POD. We can only specify the Node name before the creation of the POD.
  - If the POD is already created, then create a binding object & send a post request to the pod binding API.
  - In the binding object, we need to specify a target node with the name of the node. Then send a post request to the pods binding API with the data.

  ```yaml
  # pod-binding-definition.yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Binding
  metadata:
    name: nginx
  target:
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Node
    name: node01
  ```

- Post request
  - `curl --header "Content-Type:applicaion/json" --request POST --data '{"apiVersion":"v1", "kind": "Binding" ... }' http://$SERVER/api/v1/namespaces/default/pods/$PODNAME/binding`
