# Daemon Sets

- Daemon Sets are like Replica Sets. It helps to deploy multiple instances of POD but it runs one copy of POD on each Node in the cluster.
- Whenever a new Node is added to the cluster a replica of the POD is automatically added to that Node & when a Node is removed the POD is automatically removed.
- **The Daemon Set ensures that one copy of the POD is always present in all Nodes in the cluster.**
- Use Cases of Daemon Sets
  - Node Monitoring (Deploy Monitoring Agent)
  - Logs Viewer (Log Collector)
  - *One of the Worker Node component that is required on every Node in the cluster is a Kube-Proxy.* - This is also a good use case of Daemon Set to deploy Kube-Proxy component as Daemon Set.
  - Networking - networking solution like weave-net requires an agent to be deployed on each Node in the cluster.

- One way to create DaemonSet in every node is to specify by `nodeName` [Default in K8S v1.12]
- Another way is to use nodeAffinity and default scheduler to create Daemonset in every node. [Default in K8S v1.12 onwards]

```yaml
# daemon-set-definitions.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: monitoring-daemonset
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: monitoring-agent
  template:
    metadat:
      labels:
        app: monitoring-agent
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: monitoring-agent
        image: monitoring-agent
```

- `kubectl create -f daemon-set-definitions.yaml`
- `kubectl get daemonsets -o wide`
