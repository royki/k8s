# Static Pod

| Static POD | DaemonSet |
|-|-|
|Static POD is created by `kubelet` without any interference from the `kube-api` server|DaemonSets ensures one instance of an application is available on all Node in the cluster. It is handled by a `Daemonset Controller` through `kube-api` server.|
|Static POD can be used to deploy the Kubernetes Control Plane Components itself|DaemonSets are used to deploy Monitoring Agents, Network Agents, Logging Agents on each Node|

- *Both `Static POD` & `POD created by DaemonSet` are ignored by `Kube-Scheduler`. The `Kube-Scheduler` has no effect on these PODs.*
- **Create a static pod named static-busybox that uses the busybox image and the command sleep 1000**
  - `kubectl run --restart=Never --image=busybox static-busybox --dry-run -o yaml --command -- sleep 1000 > /etc/kubernetes/manifests/static-busybox.yaml`

- Edit the image on the static pod to use
  - `kubectl run --restart=Never --image=busybox:1.28.4 static-busybox --dry-run=client -o yaml --command -- sleep 1000 > /etc/kubernetes/manifests/static-busybox.yaml`
- POD manifests file path for static pod
  - `kubelet.service` file
    - `--pod-manifest-path=/etc/kubernetes/manifests`
- Another way to setup static pod path is to define in `kubeconfig.yaml` file in `kubelet.service`
  - `--config=kubeconfig.yaml`
  - `kubeconfig.yaml` file contains the path as `staticPodPath: /etc/kubernetes/manifest`

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    run: static-busybox
  name: static-busybox
spec:
  containers:
  - command:
    - sleep
    - "1000"
    image: busybox
    name: static-busybox
    resources: {}
  dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
  restartPolicy: Never
status: {}
```

## Note

- Only Static POD can be created in this way. You cannot create replicasets or deployments or services by placing a definition file in the designated
- You can view them by running the Docker ps command. Not by kubectl command in the node.
  - Kubectl utility works with the kube-apiserver. Since we don’t have an API server now, no kubectl utility. which is why we're using the docker command.
- When there is an API server requesting the Kubelet to create pods -
  - The first is through the POD definition files from the static pods folder
  - The second, is through an HTTP API endpoint. And that is how the kube-apiserver provides input to kubelet.
- So The kubelet can create both kinds of PODs – the staticpods and the ones from the api server - at the same time.
- If you run the kubectl get pods command on the master node, the static pods will be listed as any other pod.
- UseCase
  - Since static pods are not dependent on the Kubernetes control plane, you can use static pods to deploy the control plane components itself as pods on a node. Start by installing kubelet on all the master nodes.
  - If any of these services were to crash since it's a static pod it will automatically be restarted by the kubelet.
