# Kube-Scheduler

- `Scheduler` is only responsible for deciding which Pod goes on which Node. It doesn't deploy POD on the Node.
- `kubelet` actually  deploy POD on Node and `Scheduler` decides on which Node POD will be deployed.

- Install kube-scheduler
  - via kubeadm tool - kubeadm deploys the kube-apiserver as a POD on the master node in kube-system namesapce.
    - `kubectl get pods -n kube-system`
      - `kube-apiserver-master` in `kube-system` namesapce
    - `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-scheduler.yaml`
  - using binary
    - `/etc/systemd/system/kube-scheduler.service` in `[Scheduler]` section
    - `ps -aux | grep kube-scheduler`
    - install as a service in the kubernetes master node. `kube-apiserver.service`
- The scheduler goes through two phases to identify best Node for pods.
  - The 1st phase Filter Nodes, the scheduler filters out nodes which don't fit the profile of pods.
  - The 2nd phase is to Rank Nodes, from 0 - 10. Scheduler calculates the amount of resources after the pod is placed on the Node.
