# Rollout & Versioning

- When a deployment is created, it triggers a rollout.
- A new rollout creates a new `Deployment Revision`(ex: `Revision-01`)
- When the applicaion is upgraded (like when the container verion is updated to a new one)a new rollout is triggered and a new `Deployment Revision` is created.(Ex: `Revision-02`)
- This helps to keep track of the changes made to the deployment and enables to rull back to a previous version of deployment if necessary.

## Status of Rollout

- `kubectl rollout status deployment_name`
- `kubectt rollout history deployment_name`

## Deployment Strategy

- One way to upgrade these to a newer version is to destroy all of these and then create newer versions of application instances.
  - meaning first destroy the five running instances and then deploy five new instances of the new application version.
  - The problem with this, as you can imagine, is that during the period after the older versions are down and before any newer version is up, the application is down and inaccessible to users.
- This strategy is known as the *Recreate* Strategy.
  - This strategy is not default strategy.
  - `kubectl describe deployment deployment_name` => When the recreated strategy was used, the events indicate that the old Republicas were scaled down to zero first and then the new replica sets scaled up to five.
  - The second strategy is where we did not destroy all of them at once.
- Instead, we take down the older version and bring up a newer version, one by one.
  - This way, the application never goes down and the upgrade is seamless.
- Remember, if you do not specify a strategy while creating the deployment, it will assume it to be Rolling Update.
  - *Rolling Update* is the default deployment strategy.
  - `kubectl describe deployment deployment_name` => When the rolling update strategy was used, the old replica set was scaled down one at a time, simultaneously scaling up the new replica set, one at a time.

- When the application is upgraded, deployment object creates a new replica set under the hood and starts deploying the containers there at the same time, taking down the parts in the old replica set following a rolling update strategy.
  - This can be seen by `kubectl get replicasets` command.

## Rollout & Rollback

- Kubernetes Deployments allow to roll back to a previous revision to undo a change, run `kubectl rollout undo deployment_name`

```yaml
# deployment-definitions.yaml

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myapp-deployment
  labels:
    app: myapp
    type: front-end
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      name: myapp-pod
      labels:
        app: myapp
        type: front-end
      spec:
        containers:
          - name: nginx-container
            image: nginx
replicas: 3
selector:
  matchLabels:
    type: front-ends
```

- Set/Update an image in the deployment via command
  - `kubectl set image deployment_name nginx=nginx:1.9.1`
  - **If we update by `kubctl set` command, there will be a new deployment-definitions file.** So in future, if we need to update anything in the deployment again, we need to careful about the deployment definition file.
- Or update the Deployment Definition file (deployment-definitions.yaml)
  - then `kubectl apply -f deployment-definitions.yaml`

## Rollout

- Check Deployment status -
  - `kubectl rollout status deployment_name`
- Check Deployment history -
  - `kubectl rollout history deployment_name`
- 2 Types of Deployment Strategies
  - `Recreate Strategy`: In this Rollout process, it destroy all PODs in the ReplicaSet & then create all new PODs in the ReplicaSet.
    - Disadvantage: Application Down time & application inaccessible to the users.
  - `Rolling Update`(default update): In this Rollout process, a new ReplicaSet(v2) is created besides old ReplicaSet(v1) and in the new ReplicaSet(v2), the new updated PODs are generated one by one along with the old PODs from old ReplicaSet(v1) are taken down one by one.
    - This way the application never goes down & the application is seamless.

## Rollback to previous revision

- To Rollback the old deployment
- `kubectl rollout undo deployment_name`

### Command

- **Create**  > `kubectl create -f deployment-definition.yml`
- **Get**     > `kubectl get deployments`
- **Update**  > `kubectl apply -f deployment-definition.yml`
- **Set**     > `kubectl set image deployment_name nginx=nginx:1.9.1`
- **Status**  > `kubectl rollout status deployment_name`
- **Status**  > `kubectl rollout history deployment_name`
- **Rollbak** > `kubectl rollout undo deployment_name`

### **kubectl run** [Obsulate Now from K8S v1.19]

- `kubectl run nginx --image=nginx` (For K8S v1.17)
- The above command infact creates a Deployment as well as ReplicaSet & not just POD.
- This is another way to create a `Deployment` only using a image name, not specifing in the `deployment-definition` file. The required ReplicaSet & POD are automatically created in the backend.
