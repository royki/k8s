# Controller

- Replication-Controller: Replication-Controller helps to run multiple instances of a single POD in the Kubernetes cluster. Thus it helps in HA.
- In a single Node as well, ReplicaSet-Controller helps to bring a new POD if any POD dies in the single node.
- Replication-Controller ensures that the specified numbers of POD running in the Node all the time.
- ReplicaSet-Controller also helps to share the loads accorss different POD.(Load balancing & scaling) as well as create PODs to manage the load accorss different Nodes.

## Replication Controller and Replica Set

- Both has the same purpose.
- ReplicationController is replaced by ReplicaSet.
- ReplicaSet requires a selector definition. The selector section helps the ReplicaSet to identify what PODs fall under it.
- ReplicaSet also manages Pods that are not part of the ReplicaSet, that's why we need selector.
- ReplicaSet is to monitor the active PODs. If any POD fails/dies ReplicaSet is to deploy a new one, within the number of replicas.
- Labels in selector section in ReplicaSet helps to identifies which POD, ReplicaSet would monitor.
- To Scale the POD
  - change the number of pods in `replicas` in replicaset/replicacontroller definition file and then apply via `kubectl` command - `kubectl replace -f replicaset.yml`
  - Or Scale directly via `kubectl` command - `kubectl scale --replicas=6 -f replicaset.yml`
  - Or Apply directly to the running replicaset by TYPE-NAME format - `kubectl scale --replicas=6 TYPE NAME` [TYPE = replicaset; NAME = myapp-replicaset]
- If the PODs are already created and we need to create a ReplicaSet/RepicationController to monitor those pod by selector/matchLabels, ReplicaSet/RepicationController will not create any extra pod on wards, as the PODs are already exist.
