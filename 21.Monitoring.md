# Monitoring

- Node level metrics such
  - as the number of nodes in the cluster,
  - how many of them are healthy
  - performance metrics such as CPU. Memory, network and disk utilization.

- POD level metrics such as
  - the number of PODs
  - performance metrics of each POD such as the CPU and Memory consumption on them.

- Kubernetes does not come with a full featured built-in monitoring solution.
- There are a number of open-source solutions available today, such as the Metrics-Server, Prometheus, Elastic Stack, and proprietary solutions like Datadog and Dynatrace.
- *Heapster* was one of the original projects that enabled monitoring and analysis features for kubernetes.
- Heapster is now Deprecated and a slimmed down version was formed known as the *Metrics Server*.
- You can have one metrics server per kubernetes cluster the metric server retrieves metrics from each of the kubernetes nodes and pods, aggregates them and stores them in memory.
- Note that the metric server is only an in memory monitoring solution and does not store the metrics.
- *Kubernetes runs an agent on each node known as the kubelet, which is responsible for receiving instructions from the kubernetes API master server and running PODs on the nodes.*
- The kubelet also contains a subcomponent known as as cAdvisor or *Container Advisor*. *cAdvisor* is responsible for retrieving performance metrics from pods, and exposing them through the kubelet API
- For minikube -
  - `minikube addons enable metrics-server`
  - `kubectl top node`
  - `kubectl top pod`

- Identify the node that consumes the most CPU, Memory
  - `kubectl top node  --sort-by='cpu' --no-headers | head -1`
  - `kubectl top node  --sort-by='memory' --no-headers | head -1`
- Identify the POD that consumes the most Memory.
  - `kubectl top pods  --sort-by='memory' --no-headers | head -1`
  - `kubectl top pods  --sort-by='cpu' --no-headers | head -1`
- Identify the POD that consumes the least CPU.
  - `kubectl top pods  --sort-by='cpu' --no-headers | tail -1`
