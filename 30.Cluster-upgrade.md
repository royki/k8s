# Cluster Component Upgrade

- Cluster Component
  - kube-apiserver
  - Controller-manager
  - kube-scheduler
  - kubelet
  - kube-proxy
  - kubectl
  - ETCD Cluster
  - CoreDNS

- Control-Plane Components
  - kube-apiserver - the primary component in the Control-Plane and it has the highest release version. [v(X)]
  - Controller-manager, kube-scheduler - can be 1 version lower. [v(X-1)]
  - kubelet, kube-proxy - can be 2 version lower [v(X-2)]
  - kubectl - can be higher than kube-apiserver or can be lower also or same version of kube-apiserver [v(X+1) > v(X-1)]

- The recommended approach is to upgrade one minor version at a time.

## If Cluster is deployed using kubeadm

- `kubeadm upgrade plan`
  - Current cluster version
  - kubeadm version
  - Latest stable version
  - Control-Plane component version and available update version
  - kubelet version of each node

- Upgrade `kubeadm` in the cluster
  - On Master Node
    - `apt upgrade kubeadm=x.x.x -y`
    - Upgrade cluster using `kubeadm`
      - `kubeadm upgrade apply`
    - Upgrade `kubelet`
      - `apt upgrade kubelet=x.x.x -y`
  - On Worker Node
    - Drain the Worker node
      - `kubectl drain node-1`
    - Upgrade `kubeadm` & `kubelet`
      - `apt upgrade kubeadm=x.x.x -y`
      - `apt upgrade kubelet=x.x.x -y`
    - Upgrade node configuration by `kubeadm`
      - `kubeadm upgrade node config --kubelet-version vX.X.X`
    - Restart kubelet service
      - `systemctl restart kubelet`
    - Make Node as schedulable [As the node was unschedulable due to apply `drain`]
      - `kubectl uncordon node-1`
