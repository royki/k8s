# Taints & Tolerations

- Taints & Tolerations are used to set restrictions on what Pods can be scheduled on a Node.
- Taints are set in Nodes and Torelations are set in Pods.
- *Taints & Tolerations don't tell the POD to go to a particular Node rather it tells the Node only to accept PODs which have certain tolerations.*

## Taints

- Taints are set in Nodes
- `kubectl taint nodes node-name key=value:taint-effect`
- What happens to the PODs that do not tolerate the taints?
  - There are 3 Taint Effects -
    - `NoSchedule` - If this taint is set to node, no pod will be scheduled on this node.
    - `PreferNoSchedule` - If this taint is set to node, scheduler will try to avoid to place pods on this node, but there is no gurantee of that.
    - `NoExecute` - If this taint is set to node, new pods will not be scheduled on this node and existing pods on the node if any, will be evicted, it they don't tolerate the taint.
  - `kubectl taint nodes node1 app=blue:NoSchedule`
  - `kubectl taint nodes node01 env_type=production:NoSchedule`

## Tolerations

- Tolerations are applied in Pods

```yml
# pod definition with tolerations
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: myapp-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx-container
      imange: nginx
  tolerations:
    - key: "app"
      operator: "Equal"
      value: "blue"
      effect: "NoSchedule"
```

## Taint - NoExecute

- Node with `NoExecute` taint and Pod with same toleration, may not place the pod with that Node, That Pod can be placed with another Node which have no taint effect. This is because Taints & Tolerations are only accept pod with certain toleration.

## Taint On Master Node

- `kubectl describe node kubemaster | grep -i Taint`
  - `Taints: node-role.kubernetes.io.master:NoSchedule`
- *The scheduler doesn't schedule any pod in the Master Node -*
  - *When a Kubernetes Cluster is first set up, a taint is automatically setup in the Master Node that prevents scheduler to schedule a POD on Master Node.*
  - It is Good Practice not to deploy application workload on Master Node.
- Untained on Master Node
  `kubectl taint nodes master node-role.kubernetes.io/master:NoSchedule-`
- `kubectl taint nodes node01 spray=mortein:NoSchedule`
