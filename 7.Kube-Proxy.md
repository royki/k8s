# Kube-Proxy

- Within Kubernetes cluster, every pod can reach to every other pod.
- `kube-proxy` is a process that runs on each node in the kubernetes cluster.
- Its job is to look for new services & every time a new service is created, it creates the appropriate rules on each node to forward traffic to those service to the backend pods.
  - using `IPTABLES` rules.
- Installation of kube-proxy
  - use the kube-proxy binary & install it as a service. `kube-proxy.service`
  - or `kubeadm` tool deploys `kube-proxy` as POD on each node.
  - `kube-proxy` is actually deployed as a daemon set, so a single POD is always deployed on each node in the cluster.
  - `kubectl get pods -n kube-system`
  - `kubectl get daemonset -n kube-system`
    - `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-proxy.yaml`
  - using binary
    - `/etc/systemd/system/kube-proxy.service`
    - `ps -aux | grep kube-proxy.service`
    - install as a service in the kubernetes worker node. `kube-proxy.service`
