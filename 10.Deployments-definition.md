# Deployments

- Kubernetes deployments manage *stateless* services running on your cluster (as opposed to for example StatefulSets which do manage stateful services). Their purpose is to keep a set of identical pods running and upgrade them in a controlled way â€“ performing a rolling update by default.
- `Pods` - runs one or more closely related containers
- A `ReplicaSet` ensures that a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time.
- However, a `Deployment` is a higher-level concept that manages ReplicaSets and provides declarative updates to `Pods` along with a lot of other useful features.
- `Services` - sets up networking in a Kubernetes cluster
- `Deployment` - Maintains a set of identical pods, ensuring that they have the correct config and that the right number of them exist.

## deployments-definition.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myapp-deployment
  labels:
    app: myapp
    type: front-end
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      name: myapp-pod
      labels:
        app: myapp
        type: front-end
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx-container
          image: nginx
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      type: front-end
```

- `kubectl create deployment --image=kodekloud/webapp-color webapp --dry-run -o yaml`

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    app: webapp
  name: webapp
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: webapp
  strategy: {}
  template:
    metadata:
      creationTimestamp: null
      labels:
        app: webapp
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: kodekloud/webapp-color
        name: webapp-color
        resources: {}
status: {}
```

- Create Deployment with replica
  - `kubectl run nginx-deployment --image=nginx --replicas=3`

- Scale the Deployment by run this
  - `kubectl scale deployment/webapp --replicas=3`
  - `kubectl scale deployment.v1.apps/nginx-deployment --replicas=10`
  - `kubectl autoscale deployment.v1.apps/nginx-deployment --min=10 --max=15 --cpu-percent=80`
  - or edit the deployment definitions file `kubectl edit deployment webapp`
- Rollout
  - Set Image
    - `kubectl set image deployment/nginx-deployment nginx=nginx:1.16.1 --record`
  - Check the Rollout status
    - `kubectl rollout status deployment.v1.apps/nginx-deployment`
  - Rollout Histoty
    - `kubectl rollout history deployment.v1.apps/nginx-deployment`
    - `kubectl rollout history deployment.v1.apps/nginx-deployment --revision=2` (To see each version)
  - Annotating the Deployment with
    - `kubectl annotate deployment.v1.apps/nginx-deployment kubernetes.io/change-cause="image updated to 1.16.1"`
  - Set Resources
    - `kubectl set resources deployment.v1.apps/nginx-deployment -c=nginx --limits=cpu=200m,memory=512Mi`
  - Pause Rollout
    - `kubectl rollout pause deployment.v1.apps/nginx-deployment`
  - Resume Rollout
    - `kubectl rollout resume deployment.v1.apps/nginx-deployment`
- Rollback
  - `kubectl rollout undo deployment.v1.apps/nginx-deployment`
  - `kubectl rollout undo deployment.v1.apps/nginx-deployment --to-revision=2` (by revision)
