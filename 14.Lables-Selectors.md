# Lables and Selectors

- Lables & selectors are to group things together

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    run: nginx-pod
  name: nginx-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - image: nginx
    name: nginx-pod
    resources: {}
  dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
  restartPolicy: Always
status: {}

```

- `kubectl get pod --selector run=nginx-pod`

- For ReplicaSet to select the Pod

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: nginx-rs
  labels:
    app: nginx-rs
spec: # what inside the object is created
  replicas: 3
  # Selector definition in Replica Set, helps to identify what pods are under it.
  # Replica Set also manages Pods that are not part of the ReplicaSet, that's why we need selector
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      run: nginx-pod
      type: front-end
  # POD template
  template:
    metadata:
      name: nginx-pod
      labels:
        run: nginx-pod
        type: front-end
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx-pod-container
        image: nginx
```

- For Service

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: service-pod
spec:
  selector:
    run: nginx-pod
  ports:
  - name:  TCP
    port:  80
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 9376
```
