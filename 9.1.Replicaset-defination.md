# Replication Controller

- Define in rc-definition.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: RepicationController
metadata:
  name: myapp-rc
  labels:
    app: myapp
    type: front-end
spec: # what inside the object is created
  # POD template
  template:
    metadat:
      name: myapp-pod
      labels:
        app: myapp
        type: front-end
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx-controller
        image: nginx

replicas: 3
```

- Create replica by following command: `kubectl create -f rc-defination.yml`
- Get Replica details by following command: `kubectl get replicationcontroller`
- Get Pod details by following command: `kubectl get pods`

## Replica Sets

- Define in rs-definition.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: myapp-rs
  labels:
    app: myapp
    type: front-end
spec: # what inside the object is created
  replicas: 3
  # Selector definition in Replica Set, helps to identify what pods are under it.
  # Replica Set also manages Pods that are not part of the ReplicaSet, that's why we need selector
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      type: front-end
  # POD template
  template:
    metadata:
      name: myapp-pod
      labels:
        app: myapp
        type: front-end
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx-controller
        image: nginx

```

- Create replica by following command
  - `kubectl create -f rs-defination.yml`
- Get Replica details by following command
  - `kubectl get replicaset`
- Get Pod details by following command
  - `kubectl get pods`

## Labels & Selectors

- Labels in POD definition YAML file and Use that Labels in ReplicaSet YAML file that ReplicaSet can monitor the pods.

```yml
# pod-definition.yml
metadata:
  name: myapp-pod
  labels:
    tier: front-end
```

```yml
#replicaset-definition.yml
selector:
  matchLabels:
    tier: front-end
```

- Scale Replica Sets - change number of `replicas` field from the definition
  - Run -> `kubectl replace -f rc-definition.yml`
  - or Run -> `kubectl scale --replicas=6 -f rc-definition.yml.` It'll scale the replica sets but ll not update the rc-definition.yml file.
  - or Run -> `kubectl scale --replicas=6 replicaset[TYPE] myapp-replicaset[NAME]`

## Delete all underlying PODs from Replica Set

- `kubectl delete replicaset myapp-replicaset`

## Edit ReplicaSet or Pod

- `kubectl edit pods POD_NAME`
- `kubectl edit rs RC_NAME`
