# Node Selector

## _Label a Node_

- `kubectl label nodes <node-name> <label-key>=<label-value>`
- `kubectl label nodes node-1 size=Large`
- Use this Node label in the Pod to select a Node on which Pod gets deployed

## _Use Label of Node in Pod by nodeSelector_

```yml
#  pod definition file with nodeSelector
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: myapp-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: data-processor
      image: data-processor
  nodeSelector:
    size: Large
# PS: The key-value pair `size: Large` labels assigned to the node. The scheduler matches the lable and identify the node to place the pod.
```

- In complex scenario, we need to use `Node Affinity`
- Node Affinity is to ensure, pods are hosted in particular node.
- Node Affinity features provide the advance capabilities to limit pod placement to place pod on specific node.

### _Using Node Affinity in Pod_

```yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: myapp-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: data-processor
      image: data-processor
  affinity:
    nodeAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        nodeSelectorTerms:
          - matchExpressions:
            - key: size
              operator: In # (Other operator:) NotIn, Exists
              # operator: Exists # This operator check if label in Node exists or not, it doen't need the `values` section as it doesn't compare the values
              values:
                - Large
                - Medium
                # - Small
```

### _Node Affinity Types_

- The types of Node Affinity defines the behavior of the scheduler with respect to Node Affinity and stages the life-cycle of Pods.
- 2 Types of Node Affinity
  - `requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution`
  - `PreferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution`
  - `requiredDuringSchedulingrequiredDuringExecution`

||DuringScheduling( Pod doesn't exist & creates 1st time.)|DuringExecution(Pod has been running and the env is (ex: Node Label is removed) changed)|
|-|----------------|--------------|
|Type 1 | **required** (If Matching Label on Node is not available, Pod'll not be scheduled.) | **ignored** (Any change in Node Affinity will not have any impact on Pods when they have been excecuting)|
|Type 2 | **preferred** (If Matching Label on Node is not available, Pod'll be scheduled on any available Node.)| **ignored** (Any change in Node Affinity will not have any impact on Pods when they have been excecuting)|
|Type 3 | **required** (If Matching Label on Node is not available, Pod'll not be scheduled.) | **required** (Any change in Node Affinity will have impact on Pods. If Node Label doesn't match with the Pod Selector, the Pod ll be evicted from the Node)|
