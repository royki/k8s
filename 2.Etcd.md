# etcd service

- `etcd` is a key-value db.
- Download the binary, extract & run as seperate `etcd` service. `./etcd`
- `./etcd` listen port `2379` as default.
- In the `etcd` service, any client can be added using default `etcdctl` client/cli client.
  - `etcdctl set key1 value1`.
- To retrieve the store data - `etcdctl get key1`
- To view more information about the `etcd` service; run `etcdctl`
- ETCD database stores the information of Nodes, PODs, Configs, Secrets, Accounts, Roles, Bindings and more.
- Install ETCD using `binary` or by `kubeadm`
  - Installing by binary, it is as a etcd cluster
  - Installing by kubeadm, it is a POD in `kube-system` in namespace named as `etcd-master`
- `etcd.service`
  - `--advertise-client-urls https://${INTERNAL_IP}:2379` .
- Configure `etcd` as cluster via `etcd service` or `kubeadm`
- If etcd is installed via `kubeadm`, then kubeadm deploys `etcd` server in the master node as a POD in `kube-system` namespace.
  - `kubeadm get pods -n kube-system`
    - .... `kube-system etcd-master`
- To get all the `key value` stored in the `etcd` -
  - `kubectl exec etcd-master -n kube-system etcdctl get / --prefix -keys-only`
    - Kubernetes store data in specific directory structure. The root directory is `Registry`. Under that there are various kubernetes construct; i.e. `minios`, `pods`, `replicasets`, `deployments`, `roles`, `secrets` etc.
- To configure multiple `etcd` server in multiple master node in HA cluster.
  - `--initial-cluster controller-0=https://${CONTROLLER0_IP}:2380, controller-1=https://${CONTROLLER0_IP}:2380`

- ETCDCTL is the CLI tool used to interact with ETCD.

- ETCDCTL can interact with ETCD Server using 2 API versions - Version 2 and Version 3.  By default its set to use Version 2. Each version has different sets of commands.

- For example ETCDCTL version 2 supports the following commands:

  ```shell
  etcdctl backup
  etcdctl cluster-health
  etcdctl mk
  etcdctl mkdir
  etcdctl set
  ```

- Whereas the commands are different in version 3

  ```shell
  etcdctl snapshot save
  etcdctl endpoint health
  etcdctl get
  etcdctl put
  ```

- To set the right version of API set the environment variable ETCDCTL_API command
  - `export ETCDCTL_API=3`

- Bydefault API Version is 2.
- Apart from that, you must also specify path to certificate files so that ETCDCTL can authenticate to the ETCD API Server. The certificate files are available in the etcd-master at the following path. We discuss more about certificates in the security section of this course. So don't worry if this looks complex:

  ```shell
  --cacert /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt
  --cert /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt
  --key /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key
  ```

- `kubectl exec etcd-master -n kube-system -- sh -c "ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl get / --prefix --keys-only --limit=10 --cacert /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt --cert /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt  --key /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key"`
